Popsicle: a type system pre-processor for LaTeX.  Sorry, documentation is sparse
as this is mostly intended for my internal use (though I would be happy for others to
play with it).  Soon I'll publish a sample file or two.

For now, though, you can install it using:

    python setup.py install
    
You can then create popsicle files (I use the extension .pop, but it doesn't matter).
I usually make the file itself executable and then add a line like:

    #!/usr/bin/env popsicle UTF-8
    
to the top.  Now, executing the file will cause LaTeX to be emitted.
